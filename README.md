üñãÔ∏è Handwritten Digit Recognition with Machine Learning
This project uses the Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits dataset from the University of California, Irvine to demonstrate how machine learning can be used to recognize handwritten digits. 

The 1,797 grayscale images in the dataset are each an 8x8 array of integers representing digits from 0 to 9 and ranging from 0 to 16. The project's main method for classifying the dataset's digits is logistic regression. 

The notebook guides the user through importing the dataset, displaying a portion of the numbers, training the model, and assessing its output. 

The key features include data visualization, where you'll see how the digits appear both numerically and visually, model training with Logistic Regression to predict the digits, and evaluation, where the model's performance is assessed using various metrics. 

The Digit Classification.ipynb, the primary notebook with the project's code and descriptions, is part of the file structure.

Install the required dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt after cloning the repository to get started. After that, run the cells in the notebook to view the outcomes. Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Python 3.x are required for this project.

The UCI Machine Learning Repository's Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits dataset was utilized.

Following model training, the notebook will show the classification outcomes and accuracy metrics, giving a clear picture of the model's performance in handwritten digit recognition.
